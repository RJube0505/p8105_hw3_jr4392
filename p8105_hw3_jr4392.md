## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")
```

The data `instacart` has 1384617 observations and 15 variables. Some key
variables are `order_id`: order identifier, `product_id`: product
identifier, `add_to_cart_order`: order in which each product was added
to cart , `user_id`: customer identifier, `order_number`: the order
sequence number for this user (1=first, n=nth), `order_dow`: the day of
the week on which the order was placed, `order_hour_of_day`: the hour of
the day on which the order was placed, `product_name`: name of the
product, `aisle_id`: aisle identifier, `department_id`: department
identifier, `aisle`: the name of the aisle. Order_id 1 is made by
user_id 112108. The 4th order is made on the 4th day of the week at 10.
The product Bulgarian Yogurt with product_id 49302 is on aisle_id 120
which is yogurt from dairy eggs department.

The difference in the number of men and women between those below high
school and those above high school is small. There is one more female
below high school and three more females above high school. There are 12
more males than females in the high school equivalent.

![](p8105_hw3_jr4392_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png)<!-- -->

At levels less than high school, the age distribution of men and women
is roughly the same. At the high school equivalent level, females are
older than males. At the more than high school level, males are slightly
older than females.

``` r
merge_nhanes |>

At all levels of education, total activity decreases with age for both
sexes. At levels of education less than high school, total activity is
higher for females before age 40 and for males after age 40. At the high
school equivalent level, total activity is higher for females. Total
activity is higher for females at the higher than high school level of
education.

``` r

As can be seen from the plot, the trend in 24-hour activity is roughly
the same for females and males at all three levels of education.
